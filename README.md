## About
Budget Management is a budgeting tool that helps you track and manage your finances and expenses in a practical and secure way.
Its key differentiator is privacy: you don't need to share your financial data with third parties. This is made possible through integration with Google Sheets, allowing all information to remain under your full control, stored directly in your own account.
